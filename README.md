# Distributed-Stochastic-Hybrid-Resetting-Algorithm-for-Global-Synchronization (MU Javed, Jorge Poveda, Xudong Chen)

Requirements: MATLAB.

The code provides here is for global synchronization of agents when the network topology is cyclic, path and complete digraphs. For an arbitrary digraph, the code is simple to edit in terms of adjacency matrix.

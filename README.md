# Distributed-Stochastic-Hybrid-Resetting-Algorithm-for-Global-Synchronization (MU Javed, Jorge Poveda, Xudong Chen)

Earlier Deterministic Algorithm: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03566

The code provided here is for global synchronization of agents when the network topology is cyclic, path and complete digraphs. For an arbitrary digraph, the code is simple to edit in terms of adjacency matrix. 

Requirements: MATLAB.

Description : 

AlgorithmDescription.pdf - Provides overview of our algorithm.

SHDS_main - Specifies network parameters and runs the stochastic hybrid dynamics to compute first hitting times.

NCLK_CDyn - Specifies the Determinsitic, Continuous time dynamics.

NCLK_DDyn - Specifies the Stochatic, Discrete time dynamics.

NCLK_JCND - Indentify the transition to Stochastic, Discrete time dynamics from  Determinsitic,               Continuous time dynamics

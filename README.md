# Distributed-Stochastic-Hybrid-Resetting-Algorithm-for-Global-Synchronization (MU Javed, Jorge Poveda, Xudong Chen)

The code provided here is for global synchronization of agents when the network topology is cyclic, path and complete digraphs. For an arbitrary digraph, the code is simple to edit in terms of adjacency matrix. 

Requirements: MATLAB.

Description : 

SHDS_main - Specifies network parameters and runs the stochastic hybrid dynamics.

NCLK_CDyn - Specifies the Continuous time dynamics.

NCLK_DDyn - Specifies the Stochatic, Discrete time dynamics.
